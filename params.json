{"name":"Xtend2m","tagline":"A Modular Extension for Xtend","body":"Xtend2m is an extension of [Xtend](http://www.xtend-lang.org), a versatile, extendable language with a functional flavor that even qualifies for model transformation development. It adds useful concepts to the Xtend language that enable to develop model transformations with a modular design. It is the first module concept for a transformation language with information hiding support.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nDevelopment and maintenance of model transformations make up a substantial share of the lifecycle costs of software products that rely on model-driven techniques. In particular large and heterogeneous models lead to poorly understandable transformation code due to missing language concepts to master complexity. \r\n\r\nXtend2m implements a module concept for model transformation languages that allows programmers to control information hiding and strictly declare model and code dependencies at module interfaces. With Xtend2m, we can break down transformation logic into smaller parts, so that each part owns a clear interface for separating concerns. To meet the special demands of transformations, module interfaces give control over both model and code accessibility. \r\n\r\nDesigning model transformations in a modular fashion makes sense.  In a case study, we examined the effort required to carry out two typical maintenance tasks on a real- world transformation written in Xtend. We are able to attest a significant reduction of effort, thereby demonstrating the practical effects of the interface concept on the maintainability of model transformations.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\nXtend2m adds the following concepts to Xtend:\r\n\r\n* Module interfaces;\r\n* Controlled access to model elements; and\r\n* A sophisticated tracing API\r\n\r\nXtend2m uses Active Annotations to non-invasively enhance the base language.  \r\n\r\n## Installing\r\n\r\nInstructions will be added soon.\r\n\r\n<!--*QVTr2Coq* runs on the Eclipse Modeling Tools. The following steps assume a fresh installation of Eclipse. \r\n\r\n* Download Eclipse [Modeling Tools 4.3 (Kepler)](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-modeling-tools/keplersr1) (Kepler) and launch it;\r\n* Install through menu **Help > Install Modeling Components...** [Eclipse Xtext 2.5+](http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/tmf/downloads/?project=xtext) of the Model Development Tools (MDT) project;\r\n* Choose **Help > Install New Software...** to install [Eclipse QVTd 0.10+](http://www.eclipse.org/mmt/downloads/?project=qvtd) of the Model to Model Transformation (MMT) project, [update site](http://download.eclipse.org/mmt/qvtd/updates/releases);\r\n* Download [QVTr2Coq](https://github.com/qvt/qvtr2coq/zipball/master) and import contained projects through **File > Import > Existing Projects into Workspaceâ€¦** into your Eclipse workspace.\r\n-->\r\n<!--(http://qvt.github.io/qvtr2coq/downloads/qvtr2coq-0.1.0.zip)-->\r\n\r\n<!--You are ready to use the code generator to produce Coq specifications from QVT-R programs, Ecore metamodels and instances thereof. To do so, use the run configuration **Generate Coq Code**. The transformation searches in subfolder [models](http://github.com/qvt/qvtr2coq/tree/master/edu.kit.ipd.sdq.mdsd.qvtrelation2coq/models) for files ending with .qvtr, .ecore, and .xmi. Resulting Coq specifications (.v files) are placed into [src-gen](http://github.com/qvt/qvtr2coq/tree/master/edu.kit.ipd.sdq.mdsd.qvtrelation2coq/src-gen). \r\n\r\nTo run a proof on generated Coq files, you need to install the [Coq proof assistant](http://coq.inria.fr/download), version 8.4 or higher. We recommend to download Coq bundled with CoqIDE.-->\r\n\r\n## Publication\r\n* A. Rentschler, D. Werle, Q. Noorshams, L. Happe, R. Reussner.
